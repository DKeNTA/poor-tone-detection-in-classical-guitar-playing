# Poor Tone Quality Detection in Classical Guitar Playing Using Deep SAD

This repository provides the code, dataset, and demo application for the WASPAA 2023 paper, "Automatic Detection of Poor Tone Quality in Classical Guitar Playing Using Deep Anomaly Detection Method."

This implementation has been developed with reference to the Deep SAD repository of [Ruff et al](https://github.com/lukasruff/Deep-SAD-PyTorch).
